<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>Essential is a full-stack web application created to assist Seattle's homeless and low-income community with finding shelter and hot meals near their current locations. The project utilizes:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Ruby on Rails framework</li>
	<li>Yelp API and search</li>
	<li>data-scraping technology gathering targets from www.resourcehouse.com</li>
	<li>powerful geolocation formula designed in-house</li>
</ul>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>The Essential team was inspired by a shared motivation to focus our project energies on a relevant, community-service based app that is functional immediately upon deployment. Our goal is to secure a relevant solution to a local issue.</p>

<h1>Using Essential</h1>
<p>Out of the box, Essential is ready to use by either clicking on the shelter or food icon, or typing a specific search into the form on the home page. By creating a free account, the user is able to save their favorite resources and leave useful feedback on their experience.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
